# ChatGPT_Prompt_Engineering

This short course (from : **[DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/)**) describes how LLMs work, provide best practices for prompt engineering, 
and show how LLM APIs can be used in applications for a variety of tasks, including :
 - **Summarizing** (e.g., summarizing user reviews for brevity)
 - **Inferring** (e.g., sentiment classification, topic extraction)
 - **Transforming** text (e.g., translation, spelling & grammar correction)
 - **Expanding** (e.g., automatically writing emails)
